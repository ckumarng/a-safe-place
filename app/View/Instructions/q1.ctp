   </div>You are participating in a research study on decision-making. During the

experiment you can earn money by receiving points. The number of points that you

receive during the experiment depends on your decisions. All points that

you earn in the experiment will be exchanged into dollars at the end of the

experiment.

<!--l. 31--><p class="indent" >   The exchange rate is: 10 Points = .... Cent

<!--l. 33--><p class="indent" >   At the end of the experiment you will receive the amount of money that you have

earned during the experiment in cash.

<!--l. 36--><p class="indent" >   The experiment consists of ..... parts and a questionnaire. Each part will be

introduced on a screen with the header &#8220;Instructions&#8221;. These instructions

will explain in detail what the respective part of the experiment is about.

Please follow the instructions carefully. If you have any questions please let us

know by raising your hand. Your question will then be answered at your

desk.

<!--l. 43--><p class="indent" >   In this experiment you will often have to solve multiplication problems. You must

solve the problems without any helping device, i.e., devices such as paper and pencil,

pocket calculators or cell phones, are not allowed. If you use any helping device, you

will be immediately excluded from the experiment and from all payments.

The experiment does not begin before all helping devices are completely

removed.

<!--l. 50--><p class="indent" >   Please note that communication between participants is strictly prohibited during

the experiment. In addition we would like to point out that you may only use the

computer functions which are required for the experiment. Communication between

participants and unnecessary interference with computers will lead to exclusion from

the experiment.
